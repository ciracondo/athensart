                <p>Athens, GA is a vibrant town located in northeastern Georgia. It is renowned for its art and cultural attractions, as well as the many creatives who live there.
                </p>
                <p>This map is a tool to help discover all of the art that Athens has to offer. The map features information that focuses on the geography of the museums, galleries, murals, and street art that make up Athens' art scene. The visual arts are the focus of this project, and the term 'visual art' includes anything from the painted fire hydrants scattered around town to the unique Bulldog statues that local businesses display to the artistic AthensTransit bus stops.

                <h1>Map</h1>
                <p>Here is a map of the locations of Athens art.</p>
                <p>Click on the legend on the bottom left corner of the map to make particular categories visible or hidden. Click on each point to view more information about the location; clicking on a point brings up an information box. If the information box is too big for the screen, click the map and drag so you can be aligned with the box. When looking at this information pop-up, you may find it easier to click the small box next to the "X" on this box- this configures it better to your screen.
                    Make sure to see the "More information here" section to find a link to an external source with more information about the art. Look closely- a few points on the map even have photographs for you to view.
