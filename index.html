                <p>Athens, GA is a vibrant town located in northeastern Georgia. It is renowned for its art and cultural attractions, as well as the many creatives who live there.
                </p>
                <p>But how does one know where all of the art is placed throughout this city? Several websites or news articles offer small bits of advice as to where to find a particular piece, but there is no
                    central map to show a compilation of all of this information and provide details to someone who simply wants to explore the undiscovered art in their town. Thus, the idea for this map project was born. The map features information that focuses on the geography of the museums, galleries, murals, and street art that make up Athens' art scene. The visual arts are the focus of this project, and the term 'visual art' includes anything from the painted fire hydrants scattered around town to the unique Bulldog statues that local businesses display to the artistic AthensTransit bus stops.

                <p>Here is a map of the locations of Athens art.</p>
                <p>Click on the legend on the bottom left corner of the map to make particular categories visible or hidden. Click on each point to view more information about the location; clicking on a point brings up an information box. When looking at this information pop-up, you may find it easier to click the small box next to the "X" on this box- this configures it better to your screen.
                    Make sure to see the "More information here" section to find a link to an external source with more information about the art. Look closely- a few points on the map even have photographs for you to view.
