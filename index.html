                <p>Athens, GA is a vibrant town located in northeastern Georgia. It is renowned for its art and cultural attractions, as well as the many creatives who live there.
                </p>
                <p>But how does one know where all of the art is placed throughout this city? Several websites or news articles offer small bits of advice as to where to find a particular piece, but there is no
                    central map to include locations of all types of the art. Thus, the idea for this map project was born. The map features information that focuses on the geography of the museums, galleries, murals, and street art that make up Athens' art scene. The visual arts are the focus of this project, and the term 'visual art' includes anything from the painted fire hydrants scattered around town, to the unique Bulldog statues that local businesses display, to the artistic AthensTransit bus stops.
